# Flatpak CLI Shortcut Proof of Concept

#
# Known shortcomings in this quick and dirty PoC:
# * Assumes command name collisions will never happen
#   (A proper implementation would need to prompt the user to resolve conflicts
#   if encountered instead of just applying "last processed wins" behaviour.)
# * In order to support non-local URL arguments to Flatpak'd browsers, use of
#   --file-forwarding assumes all installed programs will accept file:// URLs.
#   (A proper solution would parse the .desktop files to identify what kinds of
#   arguments the commands want, but I have yet to run into something I want to
#   invoke from the command-line which *doesn't* accept file:// URLs... I'm
#   guessing things like GTK's GIO and Qt's I/O classes just accept file://
#   URLs as a valid form of "local path".)
# * Just uses `grep command= | cut -d= -f2` to "parse" the INI-style output
#   of `flatpak info -m`
#   (A proper implementation needs to make sure it's from the right section of
#   the file to ensure there's no risk of multiple lines matching.)
# * Uses the sledgehammer approach of just removing all non-folders from the
#   target directory before generating new launchers to clear out stale entries.
#   (A proper solution would keep track of which ones it created and would also
#   look for more performant alternatives to spawning a `flatpak info -m` for
#   each application, which limits performance to about 13 applications per
#   second.)
# * Doesn't solve the problem of flatpaks still not installing manpages
