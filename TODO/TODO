- install.py should also handle setting up git submodules.
- Add a commit hook to verify that I haven't accidentally committed my GitHub
  token or SMTP credentials or my Geeqie last-visited folder.
- I should see if I can set up some kind of git post-clone hook for setting up
  submodules in every project I clone.
- Re-port my custom zsh prompt back to bash and include in .bash_profile.
- systemctl mask --now geoclue
- Figure out a good way to sync settings containing passwords like:
  - My complete .gitconfig (SMTP credentials and GitHub token)
  - Audacious (scrobbler password and not ideal for Git but possibly)
  - Pidgin (many account passwords)
  - Thunderbird (just plain not suited to Git.)
  - Firefox (just plain not suited to Git. I'll probably have to wait for Addon Sync)
- I need a more automatic way to build virtualenvs for my projects without
  having to sync the virtualenvs themselves.
  - Find or make an "addvirtualenv <project> [virtualenv]"  command for
    virtualenvwrapper which creates and attaches a virtualenv for an existing
    project and then runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` and/or
    `./setup.py develop` (in that order) if they exist. (All other options are
    passed to mkvirtualenv so you can use things like -i and -r and bare
    virtualenv arguments.
  - Decide on the most appropriate approach to automating the calling of said
    command on many projects.
